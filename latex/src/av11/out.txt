5 Breathe, breathe in the air
6 Don't be afraid to care
6 Leave but don't leave me
6 Look around, choose your own ground
8 For long you live and high you fly
10 And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
8 And all your touch and all you see
7 Is all your life will ever be
0 
3 Run rabbit run
6 Dig that hole, forget the sun
8 And when at last the work is down
11 Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one
8 For long you live and high you fly
7 But only if you ride the tide
6 And balanced on the biggest wave
6 You race towards an early grave
